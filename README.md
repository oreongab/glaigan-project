&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Glaigan** (Thai for "Close to Each Other") is a hyperlocal community application designed to bridge the gap between physical proximity and digital connection.

## The Problem
Despite Thai people spending an average of **8 hours per day** on smartphones, nearly half report feeling lonely and isolated. 
Current platforms (LINE OpenChat, Facebook Groups) fail to facilitate immediate, local help due to the **90-9-1 Rule**: 90% lurk, 9% contribute occasionally, and only 1% are active. This leads to:
* Unanswered questions.
* Outdated information (e.g., old Google Maps reviews).
* Irrelevant spam or commercial posts blocking real communication.
* Social anxiety preventing users from talking to strangers in real life.

##  The Solution
**Glaigan** connects users within a **2-kilometer radius**, creating a focused environment for asking, helping, and sharing useful local information in real-time.

### Key Features
* **Hyperlocal Feed (2km Radius):** Posts, questions, and reviews are only visible to those physically nearby, ensuring relevance.
* **Real-time Q&A:** Ask questions like *"Which bus goes to Central Ladprao?"* or *"Is the cafe crowded right now?"* and get answers from people currently there.
* **In-App Chat:** Seamlessly transition from public posts to private communication.
* **Reward System (Gamification):** * Users earn points by answering questions.
    * Points are validated by the *asker's satisfaction rating* (preventing point farming).
    * **Redemption:** Points can be exchanged for discounts at local restaurants and shops (e.g., 10% off at "Eggtart Retard").
